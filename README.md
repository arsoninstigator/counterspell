this year, along with a couple of other teenagers, i organized counterspell delhi, a **12-hour hackathon** for over 30 teenagers in high schools across delhi on 24 november. we ran a game jam event that brought school-going students together to collaborate to make innovative projects using their game engine of choice. this beginner-friendly hacking marathon was the **perfect creative environment for artists, musicians, and coders** alike as people could improve their technical skills by hacking on their projects and their soft skills by working in teams or around people their age in a relaxed non-competitive setting.

participants could register for free on a first-come, first-served basis and were directly involved from the very beginning where a theme will be chosen by a community vote before the event began. we provided **workshops, mentorship, resources, meals, swag, and prizes** to make this experience highly fruitful and enjoyable for all attendees. to ensure a smooth and engaging workflow, the game jam included structured icebreakers, cool-off periods, and plenty of opportunities for fun and interactionâ€”including a snack cart for refueling between intense coding sessions.
